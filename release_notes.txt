## Enhancements
- Expanded Weather Editor environment lighting to all Foundry scene properties: Luminosity, Saturation, Shadows, Hue, and Hue Intensity per channel (Day/Night)
- Added Blend Ambience checkbox to Day (Base) environment section in Weather Editor
- Weather Editor changes now update the scene in real-time with 150ms debounce

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed weather zone key mismatch — use stable _default zone key when no climate zone is configured
- Fixed disabled weather presets still generating after being toggled off
- Fixed scene ambience resetting to zero when no lighting overrides apply
- Fixed negative saturation not allowed in Weather Editor (now matches Foundry's -1 to 1 range)
- Fixed "No Zone" selection in Weather Picker snapping back to the only available zone
- Fixed weather changes not applying when "No Zone" is selected
