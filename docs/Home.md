## Highlights

### Animated Time Display

Watch the sun and moon arc across a realistic sky dome, or choose from compact displays for minimal screen space. The [HUD](HUD) provides at-a-glance time, weather, and event information.

### Flexible Calendars

Use bundled calendars (Gregorian, Harptos, Exandria, Golarian, and more) or create your own with the [Calendar Editor](Calendar-Editor). Support for custom months, weekdays, leap years, intercalary days, and year zero handling.

### Smart Events

Schedule [notes and events](Notes-and-Events) with powerful recurrence patterns—daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or advanced options like moon phases, seasons, linked events, and computed dates (Easter, lunar new year, etc.).

### Multi-Moon Support

Track multiple [moons](Moon-Phases) with independent cycle lengths, phases, and colors. Trigger events on specific lunar phases.

### Weather & Darkness

[Generate weather](Weather-System) based on climate zones and seasons. [Sync scene darkness](Scene-Darkness) to time of day with smooth transitions at sunrise and sunset.

### Eras & Cycles

Define historical [eras](Eras-and-Cycles) with custom year formatting (1492 DR, Year 5 of the Third Age) and repeating cycles (zodiac signs, elemental weeks).
